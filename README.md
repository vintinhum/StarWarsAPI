# StarWarsAPI

This project utilizes the Star Wars API at swapi.dev in an iOS app that lets the user enter a number as input and get detailed information about a character from the Star Wars franchise, correspondent to the number entered as input.

I utilized MVVM-C as a design pattern, while implementing data binding and dependency injection with RxSwift and Swinject, respectively. I also used Alamofire and URLSession to handle API calls within the application.
